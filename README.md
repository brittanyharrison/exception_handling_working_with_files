# Exception Handling

# Working with files

### Examples of exceptions
- `value error`
- `syntax error`
- `out of bound`
- `key error`
- `attribute error `
 `ZeroDivsionError`
  
### File permissions

- `r` This is the default mode. It opens file for reading
- `w` this mode opens file for writing
  - If file doesnt exist, it creates a new file for us
- `x` Createds a new file, if already exists, the operation fails 
- `a` Opens file Apepend mode
  - If file doesnt exist it creates new one
- `t` This the default mode to open in text mode
- `b` This is for binary 
- `+` This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)

 **we have `try` `except` and `finally`** 

- `try` works as `if condition`
- `except` works as `elif`
- `finallt` works as `else`, will execute regardless of try and except condition
